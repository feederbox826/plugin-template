# This is a template
Feel free to customize the repository as you see fit. When you're ready for the world to see your plugins, request for them to be added to the docs here: https://github.com/stashapp/Stash-Docs/issues/new/choose

If you're developing themes, the process is almost identical, rename the folder to `themes` instead of `plugins` and edit the second last line in `build_site.sh` to `themes`
